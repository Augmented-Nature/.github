# Augmented Nature

**We decode nature's molecular language using generative AI to discover breakthrough therapeutics, learning from millions of years of evolution.**  
Our platform combines **computational biology** with **machine learning** to identify novel drug targets and accelerate pharmaceutical research.  

In parallel, we contribute to the open-source community by developing **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** that make key biological, chemical, and genomic datasets more accessible to researchers worldwide.

## üîç What We Do

- **Therapeutics Platform**: Harnessing generative AI and computational biology to uncover novel drug targets and speed up drug discovery.  
- **Open-Source MCP Servers**: Providing standardized APIs for major life sciences datasets, enabling seamless data integration and exploration.

## ‚úÖ Why It Matters

- **AI for therapeutics**: We aim to shorten the path from *idea* to *medicine*.  
- **Unified data access**: Our MCP servers provide standardized access to dozens of datasets.  
- **Open collaboration**: By contributing to the open-source community, we empower researchers everywhere.

## üõ† Getting Started with MCP

To use any of our MCP servers:

1. Pick the MCP server for the dataset you need (for example, `UniProt-MCP-Server`).  
2. Review its README in that repo for usage instructions.  
3. Query the endpoints using REST or an MCP-compatible client.  
4. Combine datasets for richer workflows (e.g. UniProt + STRING + Reactome).
